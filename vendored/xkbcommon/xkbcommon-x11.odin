	* Setup the XKB X11 extension for this X client.
	*
	* The xkbcommon-x11 library uses various XKB requests.  Before doing so,
	* an X client must notify the server that it will be using the extension.
	* This function (or an XCB equivalent) must be called before any other
	* function in this library is used.
	*
	* Some X servers may not support or disable the XKB extension.  If you
	* want to support such servers, you need to use a different fallback.
	*
	* You may call this function several times; it is idempotent.
	*
	* @param connection
	*     An XCB connection to the X server.
	* @param major_xkb_version
	*     See @p minor_xkb_version.
	* @param minor_xkb_version
	*     The XKB extension version to request.  To operate correctly, you
	*     must have (major_xkb_version, minor_xkb_version) >=
	*     (XKB_X11_MIN_MAJOR_XKB_VERSION, XKB_X11_MIN_MINOR_XKB_VERSION),
	*     though this is not enforced.
	* @param flags
	*     Optional flags, or 0.
	* @param[out] major_xkb_version_out
	*     See @p minor_xkb_version_out.
	* @param[out] minor_xkb_version_out
	*     Backfilled with the compatible XKB extension version numbers picked
	*     by the server.  Can be NULL.
	* @param[out] base_event_out
	*     Backfilled with the XKB base (also known as first) event code, needed
	*     to distinguish XKB events.  Can be NULL.
	* @param[out] base_error_out
	*     Backfilled with the XKB base (also known as first) error code, needed
	*     to distinguish XKB errors.  Can be NULL.
	*
	* @returns 1 on success, or 0 on failure.
